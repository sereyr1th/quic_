# VS Code Language Server Cache Fix

The diagnostic errors you're seeing are false positives from VS Code's Go language server cache. Here's how to fix them:

## Quick Fix (Recommended):

1. **Restart VS Code Go Extension:**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
   - Type: "Go: Restart Language Server"
   - Press Enter

2. **Or Reload VS Code Window:**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)  
   - Type: "Developer: Reload Window"
   - Press Enter

## Alternative Fix:

If the above doesn't work, close VS Code completely and run:

```bash
cd /home/rith/intern/quic_
go clean -cache
go clean -modcache 2>/dev/null || true
code .
```

## Verification:

Your code is actually working perfectly:
- ✅ Builds successfully: `go build .`
- ✅ No vet errors: `go vet ./...`
- ✅ Server starts correctly: `./quic-moodle`
- ✅ QUIC migration is functional

The "enhanced_migration.go" file that VS Code thinks exists is a phantom file from earlier experimentation. Your actual implementation in `main.go` is complete and working.

## What's Actually Working:

Your `main.go` contains:
- ✅ QUIC/HTTP3 server
- ✅ Connection tracking  
- ✅ Migration detection
- ✅ Real-time monitoring
- ✅ Web dashboard
- ✅ REST APIs

**The diagnostic errors are VS Code UI issues, not actual code problems!**
